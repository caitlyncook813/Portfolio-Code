                            <p> Upward Marketing is a digital marketing business based out of New York.
                                They use ROI (Return On Investment) focused marketing solutions that help
                                companies across the United States generate long-term revenue.</p>

                            <p>After not receiving the expected results from their website they decided to check
                                out their competition. That’s when they realized their website was going to need a
                                complete makeover to start seeing results and that is when they contacted me!

                            <p>I was given a two week timeline to redesign and improve my clients website. They requested
                                that the colors and fonts stay the same. They want their website to be modern and have character.
                                The website needed to come off as approachable and friendly. I was also told to use only
                                illustrations rather than images. </p>

                            <h2> The Challenges </h2>

                            <p>Upward Marketing’s previous website design was very unwelcoming and not pleasing to the eye.
                                The tone of the website was dark and cold. The site was very boring to the eye and had nothing
                                to grab your attention anywhere. </p>
                            <p> When designing the site I ran into a lot of problems with Godaddy website builder the most.
                                When adding code to the website it could only recognize HTML, making it very hard to style
                                anything I was working on. It also had no way to customize the mobile interface. Causing me
                                to run into the problem that somethings look great on desktop and horrible on mobile. </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the main problems I ran into was adding the moving gifs to the home page. Realizing
                                I had run into a wall, I reached out to a couple of other UI/UX designers hoping they could
                                help me or give any advice. They came to the same conclusion as me, because code insert was
                                very limited and there is no backend to edit, it would not be possible.</p>

                            <h2> The Solution </h2>

                            <p> First off I started by changing the color of backgrounds to white to lighten up the site.
                                In order to add character and life to the site I started working on some new icons for the
                                site. Rather than having a ton of icons ranging in color. I created a basic palette of
                                colors to design the icons with.</p>

                            <img src="upwardicons.png" alt="Upwards Icon Palette" class="img2" />

                            <p> Once I was finished with icons I worked on finding the perfect gifs. After I found them all
                                I started working on adding them into the site. </p>

                            <p> Lastly I worked on the main image on the homepage. As requested, they wanted a new york
                                illustration that fades on the side. </p>
